This repository hosts the scripts, plots, and data for "Measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs" by Sage Anastasi & Giulio Dalla Riva. The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191

The code is written in Julia, and packages are managed using the "project.toml" and "manifest.toml" files. It has no specific computational requirements other than being able to run Julia. If needed, packages may be installed by running Pkg.activate(“.”); Pkg.add(["list", "all", "packages", "here"]). Once the packages are installed the scripts must simply be run, although some scripts do not have the required data available (see below).

Plots used in the paper are saved in "Plots". Please note that running "11_Plot_Rsmpl_Results", "12_Plot_SBM_Results", or "13_Plot_COP_results" will overwrite these files in your copy of the directory.

Data used in the paper is saved in "Results". These are the results generated by analysing the networks selected for the paper. "COP_100_elbows", "COP_elbows_gc_100", "COP_elbows_gc_1000", "svd_vals_gc_100", and "svd_vals_gc_1000" relate to discussion of the COP climate conferences on Twitter. "pointwise_results" and "resample_results" relate to the networks of NZ accounts discussing climate change on Twitter. "sbm_dim" and "sbm_growth_dim" relate to the stochastic block models. Please be aware that running "02_blockmatrix_analysis" and "03_blockmatrix_growth_analysis" will overwrite the stochastic block model results files in your copy of the directory.

The tweet data used for "00_Input_climate_Twitter_NZ_data", "01_climate_NZ_analysis", and "04_COP" is not available due to Twitter closing its Academic API, so these elements of the results cannot be fully reproduced. Previously, the terms of the Academic API had required us to only save the Tweet IDs, so that the network could be re-downloaded in the future without infringing on copyright by saving copies of the full tweet data. Since the closure of the Academic API, this is no longer possible. However, we provide our scripts so that the code can at least be inspected for flaws, even if it cannot be fully re-run.
